# üöÄ Custom OpenWRT Image Build & VM Conversion Script

## A repeatable approach to custom OpenWRT image creation:
- Manage your own list(s) of OpenWRT packages
- Optionally resize default partitions to unlock extra OpenWRT filesystem storage
- Optionally convert OpenWRT images into into QEMU, Virtualbox, HyperV or VMware images
- Automated installation of **OpenWRT Imagebuilder** Linux dependencies

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Option Prompts

1. Enter OpenWRT STABLE release version _(or hit enter for latest snapshot)_
2. Modify partition sizes or keep OpenWRT defaults? [y/n] _(Y = follow the prompts)_
3. Enter an image filename tag _(to uniquely lablel your new image)_
4. **Optional**: Convert OWRT images to VM disk? [y/n] _(Y = select a VM format: qcow2, qed, vdi, vhdx or vmdk)_
5. **Optional**: Bake custom OpenWRT config files into the new base OWRT image _(follow on-screen directions)_
6. When the script completes, new images are located at `$(pwd)/openwrt_build_output/firmware_images`, and corresponding VM images at `$(pwd)openwrt_build_output/vm`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

**Any recent x86 Debian-flavored OS with the sudo package installed should be fine**. 
- All image building dependencies are automatically installed on first run _(hence sudo package requirement)_.
- Windows subsystem for Linux users have additional steps. See here: https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/wsl
- If building old OpenWRT versions (< = 19.x), using a Linux distro from the same era will save you many troubles with python build machine prerequisities.

## üìñ Instructions

1. üì• Download the image builder script and make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x x86-imagebuilder.sh
   ```

2. üõ†Ô∏è Customize your package recipie in the `CUSTOM_PACKAGES` section at the top of the script (the included list of packages are examples and can be changed). If you have issues with building, check builder output for package conflicts. (OpenWRT's new **apk** package manager will hopefully help alleviate package conflicts).


3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the script **without** sudo (it will prompt for sudo) and follow the prompts:
   ```
   ./x86-imagebuilder.sh
   ```
4. VMware ESXi users see [here](https://github.com/itiligent/Easy-OpenWRT-Builder/blob/main/OWRT-ON-ESXi.md) for extra required steps.

## üìÇ Persistent filesystem expansion WITHOUT resizing partitions

It is possible to add a large **persistent** EXT4 data partition that, unike any resized partitions, won't be wiped by a reset or sysupgrade.

1. After image flash or vm launch, create a new vdisk with an EXT4 partition and mount this.
2. Add this new vdisk/PART-UUID details into the /etc/fstab file.
3. Next, re-run the build script, this time adding the newly updated /etc/fstab file to `$(pwd)/openwrt_inject_files` when prompted.
   - The fstab file referencing the new EXT4 partition will now be baked into the new build, making this parition persistent even after a reset or sysupgrade _(see warnings below for more detail)_.
   -  Note that **OWRT Image Builder on x86 does not support sysupgrade image types**. For x86 you must replace your (virtual machine) OS disk with the new image to upgrade.

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- **Parition resize should only be used with x86 builds**.
  - Resize of firmware paritions on non x86 (i.e. router NAND flash memory) **will 99.99999% brick your device!!**
- **If you modify partition sizes you can no longer use attended-sysupgrade**.
  - Running sysupgrade with resized partitions will return the default partition schema & will likely brick or break things.
  - Instead, create new images from your backup config with desired resize settings, then manually re-flash/overwrite OS disk.
